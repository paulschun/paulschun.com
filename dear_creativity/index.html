Nothing could be further from the truth, in fact. I don't intentionally try to keep you away, and I really don't blame you for not coming around when I'm stressed and not thinking straight. I don't do it on purpose. I do want you to show up. I just need to remember to stay cool.</p><p>When I am able to keep a cool head and you do come by, it's pure magic. I think you'd agree. We've had so many great times together. Remember when we decided to quit our job and move to Korea and take random odd jobs there for beer and food money? We were crazy in our early twenties.</p><p>Well, I guess we're still quite crazy. Since this Korea trip, you've helped me develop a few marketable skills (programming is probably the one you seem the most enthusiastic about) and we've lived on three different continents without a clear goal in mind, other than seeking inspiration.</p><p>I guess I have a desire to end this drifting around and become a bit more loyal to you though, as you've always been there for me. You're an incredible force of nature and I think you've got something to offer everyone in the world. No, I'm not exaggerating. If you don't mind, I'd like to write about you. Frequently. I think you have a lot to offer the world, and I'll be singing your graces.</p><p>I look forward to us strengthening our relationship in the years to come.</p><p>Yours truly, Paul S.
